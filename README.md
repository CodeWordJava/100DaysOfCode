# 100 Days Of Code Diary / School of Code Bootcamp Diary
## Pre camp work

As part of my application to SoC we were asked to make a game in scratch. I had previously played with scratch as part of Harvards CS50x and didn't enjoy the site that much. However i am really proud of this game inspired by @enbiggens (on IG) digital art (https://www.instagram.com/reel/CctlEZRt7Dq/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

We were also asked to make a tribute page in codePen, i had played with this task in 2020 for another challegne so it was nice to dust off the work and revisit code i had written to see if i still understood it.

## Day 1

_25th April_

### Today's progress:
-Today i met my coding partner which was really nice as previously I have only tried to code alone. Its nice to have another brain to bounce idea around.
-We covered computational thinking

## Day 5

_29th April_

### Today's progress:
HACKATHON 1 - Rock, Paper or other......


### Thoughts:
- This task was overwhelming at first. Once we broke it down into smaller pieces it became more managable but we did not complete the task and I felt like i was blindly feeling around for answer. It was really nice at the end to have 49 lines ofr code that we had created from nothing. I want to go back and try to finish up the task when i have some more knowledge.
- This would be a great opperunity to cement the LOOP skills we have started this week and i think the more i see how a LOOP  and a FUNCTION at layed out the better my skills will become as i will be able to write the framework and the fill it in as i solve each bit of the task. While as the moment O am trying to figure out how to attack the probelm set and what the solution should look like when it is complete.

## Day 8
_2nd May_

### Today's progress:
CODEWARS


### Thoughts: 
CODEWARS was so much fun! I managed the 3 probelm sets issued by SoC and then 1 more in which i googled the potential solutions and deconstructed other peoples code to understand how they solved the issue and the thinking behind it. It was really nice to try to undertsand others code and to contribute to half written code.

The Slack channel has been great with people logging on all day to help and share idea which each other and this enviroment has made me feel more comfortable that the industry will have a place for people who think like me.

## Day 9 (BootCamp W2)
_3rd May_

### Today's progress:
 - Covered basics around the DOM and how to access elements
 - New team mates this week ! I have met Christophe and Luna before in a group exercise so was excited i got to work with them both and see how they work as an established team and what i could contribute.


### Thoughts:
 - Dom is interesting but still a huge concept. I will take a look at w3 to reinforce my understanding

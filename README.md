# 100 Days Of Code Diary / School of Code Bootcamp Diary
## Pre camp work

As part of my application to SoC we were asked to make a game in scratch. I had previously played with scratch as part of Harvards CS50x and didn't enjoy the site that much. However i am really proud of this game inspired by @enbiggens (on IG) digital art (https://www.instagram.com/reel/CctlEZRt7Dq/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

We were also asked to make a tribute page in codePen, i had played with this task in 2020 for another challegne so it was nice to dust off the work and revisit code i had written to see if i still understood it.

## Day 1

_25th April_

### Today's progress:
 - Today i met my coding partner which was really nice as previously I have only tried to code alone. Its nice to have another brain to bounce idea around.
 - We covered computational thinking.
 - We played with some CSS to make a Koala and using flexbox to play a "diner" game


### Thoughts:
 - I've not used CSS in 2 years and the Koala game was very humbling. I struggled to get anythign to work for most of the day! This felt really disheartening but i will revisit FCC to get a refresher on CSS

## Day 5

_29th April_

### Today's progress:
HACKATHON 1 - Rock, Paper or other......


### Thoughts:
- This task was overwhelming at first. Once we broke it down into smaller pieces it became more managable but we did not complete the task and I felt like i was blindly feeling around for answer. It was really nice at the end to have 49 lines ofr code that we had created from nothing. I want to go back and try to finish up the task when i have some more knowledge.
- This would be a great opperunity to cement the LOOP skills we have started this week and i think the more i see how a LOOP  and a FUNCTION at layed out the better my skills will become as i will be able to write the framework and the fill it in as i solve each bit of the task. While as the moment O am trying to figure out how to attack the probelm set and what the solution should look like when it is complete.

WIP  - in my repo

## Day 6

_30th April_

### Today's progress:
 - I forked the week 1 tasks and completed the outstanding exercises and redid the completed ones so I understood how i would approah each of the tasks. 


### Thoughts:
 - I think i will continue to fork the weeks workshop tasks as some of the code and problem solving isn't being articulated during our pair programming so i need a bit of time to work each task through rather than being given the answer by my partner.

## Day 8
_2nd May_

### Today's progress:
CODEWARS


### Thoughts: 
 - CODEWARS was so much fun! I managed the 3 problem sets issued by SoC and then 1 more in which i googled the potential solutions and deconstructed other peoples code   to understand how they solved the issue and the thinking behind it. It was really nice to try to undertsand others code and to contribute to half written code.

 - The Slack channel has been great with people logging on all day to help and share idea which each other and this enviroment has made me feel more comfortable that  the industry will have a place for people who think like me.

## Day 9 (BootCamp W2)
_3rd May_

### Today's progress:
 - Covered basics around the DOM and how to access elements
 - New team mates this week ! I have met Christophe and Luna before in a group exercise so was excited i got to work with them both and see how they work as an established team and what i could contribute.
 - We covered Event listers and object manipulation using document.queryselector
 - I learnt how in add emoji to JS
#### after Hours 

- Restarted Codecademy JS - review string concatention and cosole.log which I'm super comfortable with. Also reviewed Math.floor and Math.Randoom which are a bit rusty but i think i will grasp quickly.

 - Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays messages, with console.log().
 - We can write single-line comments with // and multi-line comments between /* and */.
 - There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.
 - Numbers are any number without quotes: 23.8879
 - Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: 'Sample String'
 - The built-in arithmetic operators include +, -, *, /, and %.
 - Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a . after the name of the object, for example: 'Hello'.length.
 - Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. For example: 'hello'.toUpperCase().
 - We can access properties and methods by using the ., dot operator.
 - Built-in objects, including Math, are collections of methods and properties that JavaScript provides. The correct format for Math.floor() or (Math.floor(Math.randon()*x))

### Thoughts:
 - Dom is interesting but still a huge concept. I will take a look at w3 to reinforce my understanding.

## Day 10 (BootCamp W2)
_4th May_

### Today's progress:
 - covered more on eventlistners and the DOM
 - looked at Asynchronous code and intro into JSON
 - Christophe took the lead on the Kayne workshop task so i need to have a play with these when I fork the repo.

#### after Hours 
##### take away notes
 - Codecademy JS 

 - Variables hold reusable data in a program and associate it with a name.
 - Variables are stored in memory.
 - The var keyword is used in pre-ES6 versions of JS.
 - let is the preferred way to declare a variable when it can be reassigned, and const is the preferred way to declare a variable with a constant value.
 - Variables that have not been initialized store the primitive data type undefined.
 - Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable.
 - The + operator is used to concatenate strings including string values held in variables.
 - In ES6, template literals use backticks ` and ${} to interpolate values into a string.
 - The typeof keyword returns the data type (as a string) of a value.

### Thoughts:
 - its really hard to get some space to digest everything that is coming in but i am hoping that i will start to recognise more as each day moves forward.

## Day 10 (BootCamp W2)
_5th May_

### Today's progress:
 - intro to fetch commands and rocket game

#### after Hours 
 - reviewed 1st 2 DOM workshops and completed them.
 - still struggling to redo these tasks without reviewing completed examples but hopeful it will come to me with practice.
 
### Thoughts:
 - Today was fairly low energy for me as life commitments had sucked a lot of my energy today.
 - GET, POST and FETCG are confusing

## Day 11 (BootCamp W2)
_6th May_

### Today's progress:
 - HACKATHON 2...Rock, Paper, Pokemon?!

#### after Hours 
 - codecadmey conditional statments and loops
 - FCCreview algorithms and data structures
 
### Thoughts:
 -Felt like i was just a project manager today getting the team to deliver MVP which was different. I think because the team was bigger it was harder to keep pushing and pulling to git.
